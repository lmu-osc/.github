Public README file

To make changes to the public-facing README:

1. Create a new branch
2. Edit the file at `profile/README.md`
3. Open a pull request
4. Either request review on the PR or self-approve if necessary

lmu-osc/.github is a ✨special ✨ repository that you can use to add README.md to your public organization profile, visible to anyone. Make sure it’s public and and initialize it with a README in the profile directory to get started.
