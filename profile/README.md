# GitHub Education for Students and Educational Staff

If you are a student, teacher, professor, or otherwise associated with a school or university, then you are likely eligible for GitHub Education! This has two main benefits that may be of interest to you:
1. Free access to GitHub Copilot which you can then link to your favorite code/text editor like RStudio, Visual Studio Code, etc.
2. Free access to GitHub Pro.

More details can be found at the [GitHub Education](https://github.com/education) site.
